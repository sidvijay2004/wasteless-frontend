## About The Project

[Wasteless](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wasteless) is a mobile application available on Google Play, designed to address the issue of food wastage in our communities. The app simplifies the process of connecting individuals or businesses with surplus food to volunteers or organizations able to transport the excess food to shelters and those in need. While primarily intended for restaurants with surplus food, Wasteless is also accessible and beneficial to the general public.
